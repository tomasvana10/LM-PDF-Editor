Edit PDF and HTML documents - An alternative implementation of [Shayem1's PDF editor](https://github.com/Shayem1/LM-PDF-editor). 

This project was mainly created to showcase my ability to implement a:

- REST API (using FastAPI)
- Command-line interface
- Reactive, user friendly form (using react-hook-form)

And as such my ability to develop a full stack app (minus any databases but I have other projects for that).

## Setup
